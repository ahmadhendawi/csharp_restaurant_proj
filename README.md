# csharp_restaurant_proj
In this project, I worked on a Restaurant Management System using C#, where a cashier can log into the system. Upon successful login, the main menu is displayed, allowing the cashier to view the restaurant menu, add new meals or meal categories, create customer orders, and generate invoices.
